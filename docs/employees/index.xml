You need to be registered with the Student Employment Office to be added to university payroll: They will check your eligibility to work, and collect the necessary tax forms. This is a necessary step for any job on campus, but must only be done once during your time at Princeton.</description></item><item><title>How to Declare Your Hours</title><link>https://wiki.tigeruhr.io/docs/employees/time-collection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wiki.tigeruhr.io/docs/employees/time-collection/</guid><description>Princeton University uses JobX to advertise and solicit applications for most student employment jobs on campus (recruiting both undergraduate and graduate students). These jobs are typically hourly jobs, and student employees declare their hours on TimesheetX. Below is information on how to use the latter to declare your hours for COS jobs.
For most UCA jobs, the Department of Computer Science does its hiring through TigerUHR. However some jobs, in particular summer research internships, are advertised through JobX.</description></item><item><title>The UCA Slack</title><link>https://wiki.tigeruhr.io/docs/employees/slack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wiki.tigeruhr.io/docs/employees/slack/</guid><description>The Slack is where certain jobs coordinate.</description></item></channel></rss>
