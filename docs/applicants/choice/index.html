For this reason, if you apply, are interviewed and offered a job of Intro Lab TA, <strong>it will override your preferences</strong>, you will be assigned to it and cannot turn it down; on the flip side, this means if you are unsure whether you might get a UCA job, applying to the Intro COS Lab increases your chances significantly.</p></li><li><p>You may be found suitable for multiple jobs, and <strong>you will be hired first in the highest priority jobs</strong> for which you have expressed a STRONG preference. If you turn down an offer for your highest priority job AND you had expressed a STRONG preference for this job, we will not offer you a position in another course and you will not be offered an UCA job for this campaign.</p></li><li><p>You may accept positions for multiple courses, up to your discretion. However it is very important that <strong>you do not turn down a job you have already accepted</strong>; failure to abide by these terms may result in a mark in your record.</p></li></ul><p>These rules are intended to provide stability for the faculty and to ensure that our most important courses are properly staffed.</p><h2 id=when-you-are-hired>When you are hired
