It also provides a description of the different job categories.\nNOTE: THIS PAGE IS BEING UPDATED FOR SPRING 2023 # This page currently contains only the COS 126/226 and Intro Lab jobs, as well as a select number of upper-level courses. It is being expanded for Spring 2023. Stay tuned!\nGeneral Job Categories # The department employs undergraduates to assist with many COS courses. The jobs are divided into three categories (most paid $16/hr):\nLab TAs who help students in undergraduate-staffed office hours Graders who grade assignments and (in some courses) exams In-class TAs who help students in the classroom (these positions are called facilitators or precept assistants) Some courses also hire a higher-level position (paid $20/hr):\nManagers who coordinate and supervise the work of other UCAs (typically managers have already worked in the course in a previous semester) Specific Job Categories # In addition to the general jobs, there are some specific jobs.\nFor instance, the Intro COS Lab (which centralizes the undergraduate-staffed office hours for COS 109, 126, 217, and 226) hires a Head Intro Lab TA or Team. The Intro COS Lab also hires a team of Interviewers, who interview prospective Intro Lab TAs.\nSeveral courses may hire UCAs on an ad-hoc basis to help with course development or tool building.\nJobs # Below is a description of all the jobs that are available, with a description of their responsibilities.\nThese jobs are not always hiring every semester, so please check TigerUHR directly for the list of jobs currently hiring.\nIntro COS Lab TA Program # Supervised by Dr. Jérémie Lumbroso (Spring 2023) and the Head Lab TA Team.\nTeam communication: Slack ( central COS UCA Slack: #lab-announcements, #126-lab, #2xx-lab)\nThe Intro COS Lab, currently in Lewis 121 and 122, is a place where students taking introductory courses can go for help in debugging their programs. The Intro Lab TAs are those glorious individuals working on the front lines, providing that help. The lab is available to students taking COS 109, COS 126, 217, and 226. The Intro Lab TAs are coordinated by the Head Intro Lab TA (possibly with an Assistant), who is an undergraduate. Most of the shifts are on evenings or weekends, and they last 2 hours. Typically, a TA either has two shifts per week, or is a substitute TA.\nFor more information about the job, the conditions for applying, and the pay rate, please see this page about becoming an Intro Lab TA job.\nThe Intro COS Lab uses the LabQueue to manage the queue of students waiting for help.\nRead specific information about the job responsibilities for:\nthe Intro Lab TA job (which requires an interview if you are a first-time Intro Lab TA) the Interviewers job (apply directly by contacting the Head Intro Lab TA) the Head Intro Lab TA job COS 126: Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach # Grader position # Supervised by Dr. Jérémie Lumbroso (Spring 2023)\nTeam communication: Slack ( central COS UCA Slack: #126-grading, #126-grading-notifications)\nDescription:\nThis position grades the programming assignments and programming exams, in Java.\nGraders work through codePost to provide high-quality, supportive feedback to introductory CS students.

COS 445: Economics and Computation # Supervised by Prof. Matt Weinberg and Pedro Paredes (Spring 2023)\nTeam communication: Email + Slack ( central COS UCA Slack: #445-tas)\nDescription:\nUCAs for COS 445 are primarily responsible for grading (PSets, midterm, and final). That is, every UCA must grade assignments, and it is perfectly acceptable for a UCA to only grade assignments.\nUCAs who are interested in other tasks (such as helping answer questions on Ed, providing advice on course policy, etc.) are welcome to do so (and be paid to do so).\nAdditionally 1-2 UCAs can instead volunteer to be the \u0026ldquo;Strategy Design Czar(s)\u0026rdquo;. The Strategy Design Czars do not grade assignments, but are responsible for maintaining the codebase for strategy design assignments. This role requires significant independence in comparison to grading, but would be fun for students who enjoyed the strategy designs more than the PSets. If you are interested in this, you should email Matt ( smweinberg@princeton.edu) and Pedro ( pparedes@princeton.edu) to discuss.\nResponsibilities (~3-4 hrs/week):\nAttend weekly in-person meeting Thursdays 4:30PM-5:30PM. These meetings will tee up grading for the most recently submitted assignment, and we will ask you to stay for the entire hour to grade assignments with other course staff in the room.\nNote:\nWe will always be as efficient as possible with these meetings (e.g. we won\u0026rsquo;t force you to show up if you\u0026rsquo;ve already finished grading, and we won\u0026rsquo;t force you to come in-person if you\u0026rsquo;ve previously attended a tee-off meeting and just need to sporadically ask questions, etc.). However, we do ask that you think of in-person attendance every week as the default, and block this time off on your calendar.\nMany weeks, Matt and/or Pedro will take a subset of interested staff out for bubble tea at 5:30PM.\nGrade asynchronously ~6 hours every 2 weeks. PSets are due every other Monday. Grading tees off on Thursday, and is due 10 days later on Monday. Because the next cycle starts soon after, we do need to be sticklers about deadlines.\nBe available for ~6-8 hours (total) of grading the final on May 18/19. You do not need to change your travel plans to be on-campus to grade the final. If you have travel plans that prohibit you from grading (even remotely) during this period, this is OK, but please let Matt/Pedro know in advance.\nThere will be no staff meeting during Spring Break, and it is entirely feasible to complete your responsibilities without working at all over Spring Break. However, some UCAs prefer to grade the midterm over Spring Break, and we will have an optional remote tee-off meeting for those who want to do so.\nBe prepared to give actual feedback on written PSet submissions to help students improve. We will try our best to make this as efficient as possible, but you should be prepared that any assignment that doesn\u0026rsquo;t receive full credit does typically require you to write something specific to that submission.\n[For Strategy Design Czars only] There is a codebase for strategy designs on github that, afaik, is complete, bug-free, etc. However, every SD still requires an initialization (TigerFile submission needs to be set up for every SD, sample files need to be uploaded for students, files need to be downloaded from TigerFile), and a run (some submissions have bugs and will crash the execution, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to figure out which ones and edit/remove them, etc.). You will also be responsible for answering any questions about the coding portion of the SDs (because Matt/Pedro may not know the answer). This requires more independence than a typical UCA role, because this has always been designed/maintained by UCAs (there is a detailed SD czar onboarding document, and last year\u0026rsquo;s czar is an ECE MSE student who offered to be accessible with questions).\n[For Strategy Design Czars only] You are free to do more interesting things with the SD codebase, if that interests you. For example, you are free to add more \u0026lsquo;check submitted files\u0026rsquo; test cases so that there\u0026rsquo;s fewer buggy submissions, write more efficient code, write new \u0026lsquo;staff solutions\u0026rsquo;, or develop any new infrastructure that you think would be beneficial. But this is entirely optional—your \u0026lsquo;responsibility\u0026rsquo; is just to make sure that SD files are uploaded in a timely fashion, and grades are computed in a timely fashion as well.\u0026quot;\nRequirements:\nHaving taken COS 445 and gotten an B+ or better\nMust be available for a weekly 4:30PM-5:30PM staff meeting on Thursdays, in-person.\nIf you apply for this position, we will assume you are generally available 4:30PM-5:30PM Thursdays for an in-person meeting. Exceptions are possible, but you should email Matt ( smweinberg@princeton.edu) and Pedro ( pparedes@princeton.edu) with your situation before applying for this position.\nCOS 461: Computer Networks # Supervised by Prof. Kyle Jamieson (Spring 2023)\nTeam communication: Course Slack\nDescription:\nThis position supports and grades the programming assignments for COS 461 (see https://github.com/kyleatprinceton/COS461-Public), supports precept content development, and other miscellaneous course duties.\nResponsibilities (~2-10 hrs/week):\nAttend weekly grading meetings\nHold supplemental office hours before programming assignment deadlines\nHold supplemental office hours before exams\nRequirements:\nHaving taken COS 461 and gotten an B+ or better COS 471: Web3: Blockchains, Cryptocurrencies, and.

This paperwork will only need to be filed once during your time at Princeton; for legal reasons, it can only be filed when you have a job offer.\nOnce your tax paperwork is filed, you can be added to the Department of Computer Science\u0026rsquo;s payroll, and start declaring hours using the TimesheetX platform.\nThe most common issue that new hires face is that they do not complete their tax paperwork, and they cannot be added to TimesheetX. The best person to contact for any issues having to do with payroll is Louis Riehl.\nOverview # Before getting paid by the Department of Computer Science, you need to be registered in two different places:\nYou need to be registered with the Student Employment Office to be added to University payroll: They will check your eligibility to work, and collect the necessary tax forms. This is a necessary step for any job on campus, but must only be done once during your time at Princeton.\nOnly once you are registered with the Student Employment Office, can you be added to the department\u0026rsquo;s time collection payroll. This is a step we will do for you, once you have filed your paperwork with the University and been hired in one of our jobs. Only when this step is complete are you allowed to begin work and declare your hours. If you have not completed the first step, our financial administrator will not be able to select you to be added to our payroll.\nOnce these steps have been completed, you will be ready to find out How to Declare Your Hours to get paid.\nYou will typically do Step 1 as soon as possible; if the current procedure outlined by the Student Employment Office, you should aim to take care of the paperwork in your first week on campus. Step 2 can be accomplished as needed as you are hired. Submitting the Student Employment Office Paperwork # Students who are not already on the payroll, can find instructions on the necessary forms to complete at this section of the Student Employment Office website. Since March 2020, the Student Employment Office has allowed these documents to be verified remotely, using video conference; it is unclear how long this practice will continue to be used. Previously, documents needed to be manually brought to the office for verification.\nAs part of your hiring, you will need to fill to U.S. federal tax forms:\nan I-9 form, the purpose of which is to verify that you are eligible to work under U.S. employment law. This will require you to show some documents to prove your identity and your authorization to work in the U.S.;\na W-4 form, the purpose of which is to determine how much the University must withhold from your paycheck to prepay federal taxes. This amount is an approximation of the taxes you might owe, usually an over-approximation which explains why consistently over 80% of U.S. tax-payers get a federal tax refund.\nGetting Added to the Department\u0026rsquo;s Payroll # You need to complete your Student Employment Office Paperwork as soon as possible ideally, before being hired by the department.\nYou have or will apply for a job with the department on TigerUHR.

Since we get so many more applicants than we can realistically hire, we need to differentiate between them, and assessing their ability to debug in real time along with their ability to explain concepts and their general helping manner is a much better way to differentiate than just looking at grades. [Currently,] we split the interviews between me and 4 other interviewers, two for 126 and two for 226/217,\nFirst, applicants apply on TigerUHR. Then, I reach out to all the applicants who meet the grades criteria (I don’t know what grade it corresponds to, but a 3/5 or higher on TigerUHR) to schedule interviews on a Calendly like. We split the interviews evenly between the interviewers and conduct them remotely, screensharing a code file with 3 bugs and having the candidate walk us through the code as if they were a TA. We use a predetermined rubric to assign a score to each candidate, and we also record comments about their approach and general helping manner. Then, we determine how many TAs we need to hire, and we hire the TAs with the highest scores.\nTAs can be hired for 226/217 or 126, either as full time (2 shifts/week), part time (1 shift/week), or subs. [\u0026hellip;]\nAs the Head TA, I am in charge of conducting interviews and hiring TAs, coordinating training for new TAs, creating the schedule, overseeing TA shadowing, and being the general point person for anything that comes up throughout the semester.\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/docs/general/contribute/","title":"How to Contribute to this Site","section":"\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGeneral Information\u003c/strong\u003e","content":" How to Contribute to this Site # This site is hosted in a public GitHub repository. It uses the Hugo static site generator and the actual pages are written in Markdown (see cheat sheet here). It is published using GitHub Pages.\nAnybody with a GitHub account, can suggest changes to an existing page with only two or three clicks, like for Wikipedia. (Anybody can also propose new pages, but that requires a few more clicks.)\nIf you have made several contributions, you may be made a collaborator and you will be able to directly modify the site without requiring approval. (Since GitHub is a version control system, all changes are tracked and it is easy to undo specific changes, if they are later identified as malicious).\nBelow we outline how to suggest a change for any existing page on the website to get you started. This is a good opportunity to get to know GitHub and version control systems, which are really important tools.\nFirst Step: Click \u0026ldquo;Edit this page\u0026rdquo; # On any page of this site, including this one, you can find a link at the bottom, or bottom-right of the site, that is captioned Edit this page. The next step depends on whether you are a collaborator or not.\nHow to suggest a change if you are not a collaborator # If you are not a collaborator, you cannot push changes to the repository directly: You must first make fork to your repository. Fortunately GitHub both clearly indicates when this must happen, and transparently creates the fork for you such that this step of the process is completely transparent to you.\nYou can click \u0026ldquo;Fork this repository\u0026rdquo; and then follow the steps outlined starting in Step 2 of GitHub\u0026rsquo;s guide on Editing Files in Another User\u0026rsquo;s Repository.\nThank you in advance for your contribution! Depending on whether the semester is busy, your contribution will be reviewed soon. Once several of your contributions have been accepted, we will likely consider making you a collaborator!\nHow to suggest a change if you are a collaborator # If you are a collaborator, there is no need for a fork: You can edit files directly as though were the owner of the files. After clicking on Edit this page, you can follow the steps outlined starting in Step 2 of GitHub\u0026rsquo;s guide on Editing Files in Your Repository.\n"},{"id":12,"href":"/docs/employees/slack/","title":"The UCA Slack","section":"For Current Employees","content":"The Slack is where certain jobs coordinate.\nIt is available at https://princetoncosutas.slack.com/, with Princeton CAS login.\nThe rosters for this Slack are automatically synchronized based on TigerUHR\u0026rsquo;s rosters.
