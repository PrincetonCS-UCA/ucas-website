Lab TAs are undergraduates hired to work in the computer labs to help students taking COS 126, 217, and 226 (the \u0026gt; Intro COS Lab). This web form will allow you to apply for any of these positions. This is an opportunity to gain experience and \u0026gt; contribute back to the department. The pay rate for each position is $15.50 per hour.\n— About grading: The duties of an undergraduate grader include analyzing submitted programs for correctness, efficiency, and \u0026gt; clarity, and providing written feedback. The workload is at most six hours per week. For some courses (such as COS 126, 226, and \u0026gt; 340), this can include attendance at a weekly grading party, to discuss rubrics, calibrate standards, and begin grading. The \u0026gt; grader is also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of student educational records, subject to FERPA\u0026rsquo;s requirements.\n— About the Intro COS Lab (for COS 126, 217 and 226): The department offers a lab where students taking introductory courses can \u0026gt; go for help in debugging their programs — the lab TAs are those individuals working on the front lines, providing that help. The \u0026gt; lab is available to students taking COS 126, 217, and 226. The lab TAs are coordinated by the head lab TA, who is an \u0026gt; undergraduate. Most of the shifts are on evenings or weekends, and they last 2 hours. Typically, a TA either has two shifts per \u0026gt; week, or is a substitute TA.\n— Some additional courses (which are not COS 126, 217 or 226) also have lab TAs: This is for example the case for COS 340. Please \u0026gt; apply as a lab TA for the specific course(s) you are interested in.\nTo apply, please fill out this form. It is not required that you be a Computer Science concentrator, but you must be a current \u0026gt; Princeton undergraduate and have completed the course you wish to assist as well as both COS 217 and COS 226 before the start of \u0026gt; the semester. Exceptions: COS 217 and 226 graders need not have completed the other COS 217 or 226 course; COS 126 graders/lab \u0026gt; TAs need not have completed COS 217 nor COS 226.\n "},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/timeline/","title":"TIMELINE FOR HIRING","section":"Docs","content":"This is a page that will contain details about the timeline.\nTypically applications for jobs that require a synchroneous interview (in person or over Zoom) close earlier to allow for interviews to be scheduled.\nFall 2021 campaign #   August 10: Applications open for COS Lab TA applications August 20: Deadline for the COS Lab TA application process + opening the process for other jobs September 1: Deadline to apply for a COS job  Spring 2022 campaign #  TBA\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/posts/2021-07-29-launch-of-site/","title":"Launching the New Site","section":"Announcements\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e","content":"This is a website to document the valuable contribution that undergraduate students provide the teaching mission of Princeton University\u0026rsquo;s Deparment of Computer Science, and to provide information on this program.\nThe goal of the website will be, among other things, to help provide information to both prospective applicants and current students about the different roles and jobs fulfilled by Undergraduate Course Assistants.\nThe website is built using the Hugo static site generator, the Hugo Book theme, and is hosted on GitHub Pages.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/employees/time-collection/","title":"How to Declare Your Hours","section":"For Current Employees","content":"Princeton University uses JobX to advertise and solicit applications for most student employment jobs on campus (recruiting both undergraduate and graduate students). These jobs are typically hourly jobs, and student employees declare their hours on TimesheetX. Below is information on how to use the latter to declare your hours for COS jobs.\nFor most UCA jobs, the Department of Computer Science does its hiring through TigerUHR. However some jobs, in particular summer research internships, are advertised through JobX.\nYou cannot be added to the payroll for an hourly job until you have completed your official employment paperwork. Please make sure you follow all steps outlined in the Before Getting Paid page.  How to Get Help #  If you have any questions about getting added to payroll or declaring hours, you may contact Louis Riehl, who oversees the department\u0026rsquo;s payroll for Undergraduate Course Assistants.\nIf you belong to the UCA Slack, you can also ask him questions in the #payroll channel.\nOfficial Instructions #  The Student Employees portal contains several useful resources, including:\n   Tutorial on JobX and TimesheetX: JobX is the platform on which you can search for a large number of student employment jobs on campus; TimesheetX is the platform on which you will declare your hours once hired.\n   Quick Tips for Time Sheet Entry\n  Step-by-Step Guide #    Go to TigerHub.\n   Hours must be reported separately for each category of job (grader, facilitator, etc.) that you may be hired in. Begin by selecting a category in which to declare hours.

This is a necessary step for any job on campus, but must only be done once during your time at Princeton.\n  Only once you are registered with the Student Employment Office, can you be added to the department\u0026rsquo;s time collection payroll. This is a step we will do for you, once you have filed your paperwork with the University. Only when this step is complete are you allowed to begin work and declare your hours. If you have not completed the first step, our financial administrator will not be able to select you to be added to our payroll.\n  Submitting the Student Employment Office Paperwork #  Students who are not already on the payroll, can find instructions on the necessary forms to complete at this section of the Student Employment Office website. Since March 2020, the Student Employment Office has allowed these documents to be verified remotely, using video conference; it is unclear how long this practice will continue to be used. Previously, documents needed to be manually brought to the office for verification.\nAs part of your hiring, you will need to fill to U.S. federal tax forms:\n  an I-9 form, the purpose of which is to verify that you are eligible to work under U.S. employment law. This will require you to show some documents to prove your identity and your authorization to work in the U.S.;\n  a W-4 form, the purpose of which is to determine how much the University must withhold from your paycheck to prepay federal taxes. This amount is an approximation of the taxes you might owe, usually an over-approximation which explains why consistently over 80% of U.S. tax-payers get a federal tax refund.\n   Getting Added to the Department\u0026rsquo;s Payroll #  You need to complete your Student Employment Office Paperwork as soon as possible ideally, before being hired by the department.\nYou have or will apply for a job with the department on TigerUHR. Once you have been hired into a job, you will be added to queue that will notify our financial assistant, Louis Riehl, to add you to the department payroll for the corresponding job.\nIf you have not filed the necessary paperwork, you will not be available to be added to the department\u0026rsquo;s payroll, and an email will be sent to you to let you know that you need to file paperwork before we can take further action.\nSample Hiring Confirmation Message #  Once you have been hired, you will be typically receive an email from Louis Riehl outlining the most important aspects of declaring hours.\nThis is a sample message from February 2021:\n This is to inform you that you have been added to the Payroll System as a XXXXXXXX in Computer Science.\nPlease go to https://princeton.studentemployment.ngwebsolutions.com/Cmx_Content.aspx?cpId=6 (“Student Employees” -\u0026gt; ”My Timesheets”) for instruction on how to enter your hours. If you have multiple roles at Princeton for which you are paid, please be sure to enter your hours associated with the correct role. For example, this includes if you are both a grader and a TA for Computer Science (we pay out these roles on different chart strings, and need an accurate accounting of each).\nPlease also note, if you do not enter your hours by the end of a pay period, you will not get paid on time! (Current period ends 2/21/2021.) Hours need to be entered by the Monday after every 2-week pay period in order to be logged in time for Payroll to process with regular paydays. Hours entered retroactively get paid as backpay, and are delayed. Please enter your hours by the end of every 2-week pay period!\nLet me know if you have any trouble entering your hours.\n "}]
