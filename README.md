## Hugo + GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions = ❤️

This website was created in 10 minutes from the [`jlumbroso/hugo-github-example` template](https://github.com/jlumbroso/hugo-github-example). It is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)-powered static site, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com), and deployed to [GitHub Pages hosting](https://pages.github.com), using the continuous integration available through [GitHub Actions](https://actions.github.com) (see [`.github/workflows/gh-pages.yaml`](https://github.com/jlumbroso/ucas-website/blob/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yaml)).
