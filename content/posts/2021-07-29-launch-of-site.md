This is a website to document the valuable contribution
that undergraduate students provide the teaching mission of
Princeton University's Deparment of Computer Science, and to
provide information on this program.

The goal of the website will be, among other things, to help
provide information to both **prospective applicants** and
**current students** about the different roles and jobs
fulfilled by Undergraduate Course Assistants.

The website is built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static
site generator, the [Hugo Book theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/),
and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
