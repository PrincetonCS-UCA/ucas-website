Today we sent the following announcement to all COS undergraduate students, with broader diffusion of this message to follow:

> _Hello, and I hope your summer is going well!_
>
> _The Department of Computer Science is hiring enrolled undergraduates (that's you!) to assist in many of our COS courses as Undergraduate Course Assistants (UCAs). This is an opportunity to gain teaching experience, work with and get to know faculty, and contribute back to our undergraduate curriculum._
>
> _Every term, we hire undergraduates in two steps:_
>
> _— We first recruit applicants for the COS Lab TAs positions. These are the undergraduate-staffed office hours for the COS 126 and COS 226/217 courses where you will help current students with the programming assignments, and teach them how to debug. We are collecting applications starting now and until August 20th, 2021. This is to allow for the longer interviewing process involved with that position. If you are interested in a Lab TA position, please apply as soon as possible._
>
> _— We will then hire applicants for general positions (grader, facilitator, office hours in other courses) starting August 20th, 2021, and until the term begins. Some positions are already open and you are free to start applying to them, others will be opened up at the end of next week._
>
> _The web form below will allow you to apply for these positions. You do NOT need to be a COS concentrator, but you must be a current Princeton undergraduate, and must have taken the classes corresponding to the position you are applying for._
>
> _The pay rate for all positions is $15.50/hour. More details are provided on the form. To apply, please fill out the form:_
>
> _[https://www.tigeruhr.io/register/](https://www.tigeruhr.io/register/)_
>
> _You can apply to additional jobs after your first application. Note, you will need to submit a .PDF copy of your Degree Progress Report (available on TigerHub) in order to finalize the form._
>
> _The general deadline is August 20th at midnight. Julia Ruskin ‘22 will make lab TA hiring decisions in consultation with the department. Applications submitted after the deadline may not be considered._
>
> _If you have technical difficulties when filling out the form or have any other questions about the program, please contact the head lab TA, Julia Ruskin ‘22, at jruskin@princeton.edu._
>
> _Best wishes,_
>
> _The COS UCA Program Coordinators._
