The TigerUHR campaign for Spring 2023 will open at the end of January 2023, when everyone's
term schedules is clearer.

If you want to be kept in the loop, don't hesitate to fill-in this **notice of interest**. This
will let us know to reach out to you *directly* when applications for Spring 2023 open up.

Please note that it is important to submit this notice of interest even if you have worked us,
as we may not automatically contact previously hired UCAs (for no particular reason other that
we don't want to spam people).
