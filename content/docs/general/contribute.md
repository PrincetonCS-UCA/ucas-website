# How to Contribute to this Site

This site is hosted in [a public GitHub repository]({{% repolink %}}). It uses
the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io) and the actual pages
are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) (see
[cheat sheet here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)). It is
published using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Anybody [with a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup), can suggest changes
to a page with only two or three clicks, like for Wikipedia.

If you have made several contributions, you may be made a **collaborator** and
you will be able to directly modify the site without requiring approval. (Since
GitHub is a _version control system_, all changes are tracked and it is easy to
undo specific changes, if they are later identified as malicious).

## First Step

On any page of this site, including this one, you can find a link at the bottom,
or bottom-right of the site, that is captioned "[Edit this page]({{% editlink %}})".

## How to contribute if you are not a collaborator

If you are not a collaborator, you push changes to the repository directly:
You must first make fork to your repository. Fortunately GitHub both clearly
indicates when this must happen, and transparently creates the fork for you
such that this step of the process is completely transparent to you.
