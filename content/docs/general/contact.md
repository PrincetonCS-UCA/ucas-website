The Department of Computer Science runs a very large Undergraduate Course Assistant (UCA) program.

UCAs provide support [in a couple dozen of courses of the Department of Computer Science](https://odoc.princeton.edu/policy-undergraduate-course-assistants), they are one of the most prized resources of Princeton—and UCAs consistently rate higher than faculty and grad students in terms of their approachability.

Because our program is so large, because we have such a diverse array of courses staffed with UCAs, the experience of being a UCA can have some variability.

We strive to meticulously follow [**the official guidance policy set forth by the Office of the Dean of the College**, in consultation with the McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning](https://odoc.princeton.edu/policy-undergraduate-course-assistants).

➡️ _Please read this guidance to understand what are the expectations that the University places on the department and the faculty in the department, in terms of providing UCAs with proper oversight, management and support._

If you have any question, concern, feedback about any part of the process: [please submit it to our anonymous form](https://forms.gle/eRJsRcUtKcuFeAvE6) — or email the Director of the COS UCA program directly.
