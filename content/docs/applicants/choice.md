Every semester, the Department of Computer Science processes about over 500 applications, for more than 250 positions (some UCAs work in several positions). We are very grateful for the interest in our courses, and we are committed to providing **a fair and transparent process for all applicants**.

Our promise to you is to ensure that our process is free from bias and provides every student an opportunity to work in an interesting, résumé-building job, as expected of us by [the official guidance set forth by the Office of the Dean of the College](https://odoc.princeton.edu/policy-undergraduate-course-assistants).

# Lifecycle of a UCA Application

## How to decide which jobs to apply to

Every job listed on TigerUHR should have a corresponding sub-section in our [UCA job catalog]({{< ref "/docs/applicants/jobs" >}}).

For every job, the catalog provides you with:

- A link to [Princeton Courses](https://www.princetoncourses.com), an aggregator of course data, in which you will be able to see a course description, as well as, for the last few semesters, the instructors involved in this course, and the course evaluations and ratings. This is important to understand the environment in which you will have to work.

  - A course with systematically high evaluations is probably both well-managed and run by faculty who are good managers.

  - A course with low evaluations may often be very rewarding, as they are the courses that would most benefit from UCAs, and in which UCAs have the greatest impact and opportunity for growth. However, it is important to understand that these courses are often run by faculty who are not experienced managers, and who may not be able to provide you with the support you need.

- The description of the job, which will provide you an overview of how the job fits into the course.

- The responsibilities of the job, are an itemized list of the specific tasks you will be asked to do, helping set your expectations.

- The requirements of the job, are an itemized list of how likely you are to be hired, if you apply for this job.

This information is provided to help you make an informed decision about which jobs you would like to apply for.

## How to express your preferences

When the applications open, you may go to [TigerUHR's registration page](https://www.tigeruhr.io/register/).

For each UCA job, you can indicate that STRONG, WEAK or NO interest.

There are a few rules to consider:

- You may be found suitable for multiple jobs, and **you will be hired first in the highest priority jobs** for which you have expressed a STRONG preference. If you turn down an offer for your highest priority job AND you had expressed a STRONG preference for this job, we will not offer you a position in another course and you will not be offered an UCA job for this campaign.

- You may accept positions for multiple courses, up to your discretion. However it is very important that **you do not turn down a job you have already accepted**; failure to abide by these terms may result in a mark in your record.

These rules are intended to provide stability for the faculty and to ensure that our most important courses are properly staffed.

## When you are hired

Once you have been hired, you will receive an email from the Department of Computer Science introducing you to your faculty supervisor.

After that point, the responsibility will be to the faculty supervisor to follow up with you and get you on-boarded.

If you have been hired for a job, but have not been onboarded, please contact us.
