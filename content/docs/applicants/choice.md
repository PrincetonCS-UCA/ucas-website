Every semester, the Department of Computer Science processes about over 500 applications, for more than 250 positions (some UCAs work in several positions). We are very grateful for the interest in our courses, and we are committed to providing **a fair and transparent process for all applicants**.

Our promise to you is to ensure that our process is free from bias and provides every student an opportunity to work in an interesting, résumé-building job, as expected of us by [the official guidance set forth by the Office of the Dean of the College](https://odoc.princeton.edu/policy-undergraduate-course-assistants).

# Lifecycle of a UCA Application

## How to decide which jobs to apply to

Every job listed on TigerUHR should have a corresponding sub-section in our [UCA job catalog]({{< ref "/docs/applicants/jobs" >}}).

For every job, the catalog provides you with:

- A link to the course, in which you will be able to see the course description.
  
- The description of the job, which will provide you an overview of how the job fits into the course.

- The responsibilities of the job, are an itemized list of the specific tasks you will be asked to do, helping set your expectations.

- The requirements of the job, are an itemized list of how likely you are to be hired, if you apply for this job.

This information is provided to help you make an informed decision about which jobs you would like to apply for.

## How to express your preferences

When the applications open, you may go to [TigerUHR's registration page](https://www.tigeruhr.io/register/).

For each UCA job, you can indicate that STRONG, WEAK or NO interest.

There are a few rules to consider:

- Staffing the [Intro COS Lab program](https://introlab.cs.princeton.edu) is the highest priority, as it serves a very large population of non-major students, and support the introductory curriculum of the department (COS 126, 217, 226 and occasionally COS 109). For this reason, if you apply, are interviewed and offered a job of Intro Lab TA, **it will override your preferences**, you will be assigned to it and cannot turn it down; on the flip side, this means if you are unsure whether you might get a UCA job, applying to the Intro COS Lab increases your chances significantly.

- You may be found suitable for multiple jobs, and **you will be hired first in the highest priority jobs** for which you have expressed a STRONG preference. If you turn down an offer for your highest priority job AND you had expressed a STRONG preference for this job, we will not offer you a position in another course and you will not be offered an UCA job for this campaign.

- You may accept positions for multiple courses, up to your discretion. However it is very important that **you do not turn down a job you have already accepted**; failure to abide by these terms may result in a mark in your record.

These rules are intended to provide stability for the faculty and to ensure that our most important courses are properly staffed.

## When you are hired

Once you **have been hired** for a position, you will receive an email from the faculty supervisor for that position around the beginning of the second week of the semester.
(You can also log into TigerUHR to check the status of your application.)

After that point, the responsibility will be to the faculty supervisor to follow up with you and get you on-boarded.

If you have been hired for a job, but have not been onboarded, please contact us.

## When you are not hired

If all positions have been filled, we will send out an email to all applicants who are **not hired** for any position for this term.
