IMPORTANT PAYROLL INFORMATION

Students who are NOT ALREADY on payroll will need to fill out the necessary forms at the Student Employment Office. [Their website](https://puwebp.princeton.edu/StudentEmployment/index.jsf) explains what you need to bring to their office to register. Read it BEFORE you come to campus. Hiring requires being on the university payroll.

Indeed, you need to be registered in two places before you can be paid by the Department of Computer Science:

1. You need to be registered with the Student Employment Office to be added to university payroll: They will check your eligibility to work, and collect the necessary tax forms. This is a necessary step for any job on campus, but must only be done once during your time at Princeton.

2. Only once you are registered with the Student Employment Office, can you be added to the department's time collection payroll. This is a step we will do for you, once you have filed your paperwork with the University. Only when this step is complete are you allowed to begin work.

This is to inform you that you have been added to the Payroll System as a Grader in Computer Science.



Please go to https://princeton.studentemployment.ngwebsolutions.com/Cmx_Content.aspx?cpId=6 (“Student Employees”->”My Timesheets”) for instruction on how to enter your hours. If you have multiple roles at Princeton for which you are paid, please be sure to enter your hours associated with the correct role. For example, this includes if you are both a grader and a TA for Computer Science (we pay out these roles on different chart strings, and need an accurate accounting of each).



Please also note, if you do not enter your hours by the end of a pay period, you will not get paid on time! (Current period ends 2/21/2021.) Hours need to be entered by the Monday after every 2-week pay period in order to be logged in time for Payroll to process with regular paydays. Hours entered retroactively get paid as backpay, and are delayed. Please enter your hours by the end of every 2-week pay period!



Let me know if you have any trouble entering your hours.



This is to inform you that you have been added to the Time & Labor Payroll System for the Fall 2020 Semester as a COS 126 Grader in Computer Science.



Please Note: If you are currently on a leave of absence (LOA), or take one in the future during the term of this employment, please let us know immediately and do not work or log any hours after your LOA has started! Unfortunately we are not permitted to continue employing you as students while you are on LOA, and any hours logged will be flagged by Student Employment and not permitted for payment.



Please go to https://finance.princeton.edu/payroll-labor-accounting/payroll/time-absence-management-project for instruction on how to enter your hours (“Students paid hourly” heading). If you have multiple roles at Princeton for which you are paid, please be sure to enter your hours associated with the correct role. This includes if you are hired for multiple role in for Computer Science (we pay out these roles on different chart strings, and need an accurate accounting of each).



Please also note, as with the previous system, if you do not enter your hours by the end of a pay period, you will not get paid on time! Hours need to be entered by the Sunday ending every 2-week pay period in order to be logged in time for Payroll to process with regular paydays. (The current pay period ends Sunday, 10/4/2020.) Hours entered retroactively get paid as backpay, and are delayed. Further, in the new system please note that we only have the ability to enter hours retroactively up to 90 days. Hours not entered beyond that need to be entered by Finance & Treasury directly (we can’t do it), and will be further delayed. Please enter your hours by the end of every 2-week pay period!
