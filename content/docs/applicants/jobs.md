The Department of Computer Science hires undergraduates to assist (as grader and/or as lab TA and/or as facilitator) with many COS courses. Lab TAs are undergraduates hired to work in the computer labs to help students taking COS 126, 217, and 226 (the Intro COS Lab). This web form will allow you to apply for any of these positions. This is an opportunity to gain experience and contribute back to the department. The pay rate for each position is $15.50 per hour.


— About grading: The duties of an undergraduate grader include analyzing submitted programs for correctness, efficiency, and clarity, and providing written feedback. The workload is at most six hours per week. For some courses (such as COS 126, 226, and 340), this can include attendance at a weekly grading party, to discuss rubrics, calibrate standards, and begin grading. The grader is also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of student educational records, subject to FERPA's requirements.

— About the Intro COS Lab (for COS 126, 217 and 226): The department offers a lab where students taking introductory courses can go for help in debugging their programs — the lab TAs are those individuals working on the front lines, providing that help. The lab is available to students taking COS 126, 217, and 226. The lab TAs are coordinated by the head lab TA, who is an undergraduate. Most of the shifts are on evenings or weekends, and they last 2 hours. Typically, a TA either has two shifts per week, or is a substitute TA.

— Some additional courses (which are not COS 126, 217 or 226) also have lab TAs: This is for example the case for COS 340. Please apply as a lab TA for the specific course(s) you are interested in.

To apply, please fill out this form. It is not required that you be a Computer Science concentrator, but you must be a current Princeton undergraduate and have completed the course you wish to assist as well as both COS 217 and COS 226 before the start of the semester. Exceptions: COS 217 and 226 graders need not have completed the other COS 217 or 226 course; COS 126 graders/lab TAs need not have completed COS 217 nor COS 226.
