title: COS UCA Job Catalog
weight: 1
---

This page provides a general description of the responsibilities of all the jobs that are available to UCAs in Princeton University's Department of Computer Science. It also provides a description of the different job categories.

# General Job Categories

The department employs undergraduates to assist with many COS courses. The jobs are divided into three categories (most paid $18/hr):

- **Lab TAs** who help students in undergraduate-staffed office hours
- **Graders** who grade assignments and (in some courses) exams
- **In-class TAs** who help students in the classroom (these positions are called _facilitators_ or _precept assistants_)

Some [Independent Work (IW) seminars](#iw-seminar-jobs) also hires 1-2 UCAs to do a combination of all three jobs (assisting in class to provide feedback to student presenting their projects, grading projects, and providing office hours for students to get help with their projects).

Finally, some courses also hire a higher-level position (paid $21/hr):

- **Managers** who coordinate and supervise the work of other UCAs (typically managers have already worked in the course in a previous semester)

# Specific Job Categories

In addition to the general jobs, there are some specific jobs.

For instance, the Intro COS Lab (which centralizes the undergraduate-staffed office hours for COS 109, 126, 217, and 226) hires a Head Intro Lab TA or Team. The Intro COS Lab also hires a team of Interviewers, who interview prospective Intro Lab TAs.

Several courses may hire UCAs on an ad-hoc basis to help with course development or tool building.

# Jobs

Below is a description of all the jobs that are available, with a description of their responsibilities.

These jobs are not always hiring every semester, so please check [TigerUHR](https://www.tigeruhr.io) directly for the list of jobs currently hiring.

## Intro COS Lab TA Program

_Supervised by UCA hiring coordinators and [the Head Lab TA Team](https://ugradjobs.cs.princeton.edu/docs/general/past-ucas/)._

_Team communication: Slack ([central COS UCA Slack]({{< ref "/docs/employees/slack" >}}): `#lab-announcements`, `#126-lab`, `#2xx-lab`)_

The [Intro COS Lab](https://introlab.cs.princeton.edu/), currently in Lewis 121 and 122, is a place where students taking introductory courses can go for help in debugging their programs. The Intro Lab TAs are those glorious individuals working on the front lines, providing that help. The lab is available to students taking COS 109, COS 126, 217, and 226. The Intro Lab TAs are coordinated by the Head Intro Lab TA (possibly with an Assistant), who is an undergraduate. Most of the shifts are on evenings or weekends, and they last 2 hours. Typically, a TA either has two shifts per week, or is a substitute TA.

For more information about the job, the conditions for applying, and the pay rate, please see [this page about becoming an Intro Lab TA job](https://introlab.cs.princeton.edu/information-about-becoming-an-intro-lab-ta/).

The Intro COS Lab uses the [LabQueue](https://www.labqueue.io/queues/intro-cs-lab/queue/) to manage the queue of students waiting for help.

### COS126 Precept Assistant

**Description:**

The precept assistant (PA) works under the direction of a COS 126 preceptor.  The PA is an undergraduate student who has taken COS126 previously and is excited to help current COS126 students learn the course material during precept. During precept, students will spend the majority of their time working on various exercises, typically in pairs. Your primary role as a precept assistant is to support students as they work on these exercises. You'll visit with each group of students, sit with them for at least a few minutes, and interject when doing so would save them time or deepen their understanding of the material (more often than not, this is not needed).

Your role is distinct from that of the preceptor, which, in addition to also assisting during exercises, includes the following responsibilities: taking attendance, making announcements, teaching instructor-led material during precept, pacing precept, communicating with students outside of precept, among other things. That said, depending on your preceptor and their teaching style, you may have an opportunity to share in some of their responsibilities.

**Responsibilities (~5 hrs/week) :**

- Before each precept, you should do the following:
  - Do the precept exercises yourself
  - Attend periodic debriefing meetings (to be scheduled)
  - Participate actively and promptly on our Slack channel

- During precept, you should do the following:
  - Show up on time to precept
  - Once students start working on the precept’s exercises, visit and observe each group of students for a few minutes at a time, assisting them when needed

**Time Commitment:**

You should allocate at least about five (5) hours a week for this position:

- 1 hour  - preparation
- 2+ hours for precept
  - e.g.,2 hrs for 1 50-min precept that meets twice a week, 3 hrs for 1 80-min precept, 4 hrs for 2 50-min precepts, etc.

## COS 445: Economics and Computation

For description and past ratings, see course page on [Princeton Courses](https://www.princetoncourses.com/course/1234012095)

_Supervised by Prof. Matt Weinberg and Dr. Marcel Dall'Agnol (Spring 2024)_

_Team communication: Email + Slack ([central COS UCA Slack]({{< ref "/docs/employees/slack" >}}): `#445-grading` and `#445-grading-subchannel-1` through `#445-grading-subchannel-4`)_

**Description:**

UCAs for COS 445 are primarily responsible for grading (PSets, midterm, and final). That is, every UCA must grade assignments, and it is common for most UCAs to only grade assignments.

UCAs who are interested in other tasks (such as helping answer questions on Ed, providing advice on course policy, etc.) are definitely welcome to do so (and be paid to do so, and appreciated for doing so), but the primary need is grading.

Additionally 1-3 UCAs can instead volunteer to be the "_Strategy Design Czar(s)_". The Strategy Design Czars do not grade assignments, but are responsible for maintaining the codebase for strategy design assignments. This role requires significant independence in comparison to grading, but would be fun for students who enjoyed the strategy designs more than the PSets. If you are interested in this, you should email Matt ([`smweinberg@princeton.edu`](mailto:smweinberg@princeton.edu)) and Marcel ([`dallagnol@cs.princeton.edu`](mailto:dallagnol@cs.princeton.edu)) to discuss.

**Responsibilities (~3-4 hrs/week):**

- Attend weekly in-person meeting Thursdays 4:30PM-5:30PM. These meetings will tee up grading for the most recently submitted assignment, and we will ask you to stay for the entire hour to grade assignments with other course staff in the room.

  **Note:**

  - We will always be as efficient as possible with these meetings (e.g. we won't force you to show up if you've already finished grading). However, we do ask that you think of in-person attendance every week as the default, and block this time off on your calendar.

  - Many weeks, Matt and/or Marcel will take a subset of interested staff out for bubble tea at 5:30PM.

- Grade asynchronously ~6 hours every 2 weeks. PSets are due every other Monday. Grading tees off on Thursday, and is due 10 days later on Monday. Because the next cycle starts soon after, we do need to be sticklers about deadlines.

- Be available for ~6-8 hours (total) of grading the final on May 16/17 (the two days right after the university take-home final deadline). If you're on-campus, we'll ask that you grade in-person (and provide food/bubble tea). If you're off-campus (which is completely fine), we'll ask that you grade remotely. If your travel plans prevent you from grading (even remotely) during this period, please let Matt/Marcel know this in advance (but you do not need to change your travel plans to be available).

- There will be no staff meeting during Spring Break, and it is entirely feasible to complete your responsibilities without working at all over Spring Break. However, some UCAs prefer to grade the midterm over Spring Break, and we will have an optional remote tee-off meeting for those who want to do so.

- Be prepared to give actual feedback on written PSet submissions to help students improve. We will try our best to make this as efficient as possible, but you should be prepared that any assignment that doesn't receive full credit does typically require you to write something specific to that submission (copy/pasting comments across solutions historically leads to confusion by the students and results in appeals that we have to resolve anyway).

- _[For Strategy Design Czars only]_ There is a codebase for strategy designs on github that, afaik, is complete, bug-free, etc. However, every SD still requires an initialization (TigerFile submission needs to be set up for every SD, sample files need to be uploaded for students, files need to be downloaded from TigerFile), and a run (some submissions have bugs and will crash the execution, you'll need to figure out which ones and edit/remove them, etc.). You will also be responsible for answering any questions about the coding portion of the SDs (because Matt/Marcel may not know the answer). This requires more independence than a typical UCA role, because this has always been designed/maintained by UCAs (there is a detailed SD czar onboarding document, and previous years' czars are often happy to answer quick questions).

- _[For Strategy Design Czars only]_ You are free to do more interesting things with the SD codebase, if that interests you. For example, you are free to add more 'check submitted files' test cases so that there's fewer buggy submissions, write more efficient code, write new 'staff solutions', or develop any new infrastructure that you think would be beneficial. But this is entirely optional--your 'responsibility' is just to make sure that SD files are uploaded in a timely fashion, and grades are computed in a timely fashion as well.

**Requirements:**

- Must have taken COS 445 and gotten an A- or better. (If you have taken COS 445 and are interested in being a UCA, but did not earn an A- or better, feel free to reach out to Matt and/or Marcel to discuss).

- Must be available for a weekly 4:30PM-5:30PM staff meeting on Thursdays, in-person.

If you apply for this position, we will assume that you'll block off every Thursday 4:30PM-5:30PM for an in-person meeting. Exceptions are possible (and we understand there will be sporadic absences), but you should email Matt ([`smweinberg@princeton.edu`](mailto:smweinberg@princeton.edu)) and Marcel ([`dallagnol@cs.princeton.edu`](mailto:dallagnol@cs.princeton.edu)) with your situation **before applying for this position**.
