This page provides a general description of the responsibilities of all the jobs that are available to UCAs in Princeton University's Department of Computer Science. It also provides a description of the different job categories.

# General Job Categories

The department employs undergraduates to assist with many COS courses. The jobs are divided into three categories (most paid $16/hr):

- **Lab TAs** who help students in undergraduate-staffed office hours
- **Graders** who grade assignments and (in some courses) exams
- **In-class TAs** who help students in the classroom (these positions are called _facilitators_ or _precept assistants_)

Some courses also hire a higher-level position (paid $20/hr):

- **Managers** who coordinate and supervise the work of other UCAs (typically managers have already worked in the course in a previous semester)

# Specific Job Categories

In addition to the general jobs, there are some specific jobs.

For instance, the Intro COS Lab (which centralizes the undergraduate-staffed office hours for COS 109, 126, 217, and 226) hires a Head Intro Lab TA or Team. The Intro COS Lab also hires a team of Interviewers, who interview prospective Intro Lab TAs.

Several courses may hire UCAs on an ad-hoc basis to help with course development or tool building.

# Jobs

Below is a description of all the jobs that are available, with a description of their responsibilities.

These jobs are not always hiring every semester, so please check [TigerUHR](https://www.tigeruhr.io) directly for the list of jobs currently hiring.

## Intro Lab TA Program

_Supervised by Dr. Jérémie Lumbroso (Spring 2023) and [the Head Lab TA Team](https://ugradjobs.cs.princeton.edu/docs/general/past-ucas/)._

_Team communication: Slack (central COS UCA Slack: `#lab-announcements`, `#126-lab`, `#2xx-lab`)_

The [Intro COS Lab](https://introlab.cs.princeton.edu/), currently in Lewis 121 and 122, is a place where students taking introductory courses can go for help in debugging their programs. The Intro Lab TAs are those glorious individuals working on the front lines, providing that help. The lab is available to students taking COS 109, COS 126, 217, and 226. The Intro Lab TAs are coordinated by the Head Intro Lab TA (possibly with an Assistant), who is an undergraduate. Most of the shifts are on evenings or weekends, and they last 2 hours. Typically, a TA either has two shifts per week, or is a substitute TA.

For more information about the job, the conditions for applying, and the pay rate, please see [this page about becoming an Intro Lab TA job](https://introlab.cs.princeton.edu/information-about-becoming-an-intro-lab-ta/).

The Intro COS Lab uses the [LabQueue](https://www.labqueue.io/queues/intro-cs-lab/queue/) to manage the queue of students waiting for help.

**Description:**

This position grades the programming assignments and programming exams, in Java.

Graders work through [codePost](https://codepost.io) to provide high-quality, supportive feedback to introductory CS students. A detailed rubric is included, and the work consists of reading and understanding the student's code, and providing feedback on the code's correctness, efficiency, and clarity according to the [COS 126 Style Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t_3faRPgonwt78eM7tthA_bsjbKy6kn22cLVv4S0Bn0/edit).

- Read the grader brief that is posted every week; communicate promptly when you are not able to grade on any given week

- Grade asynchronously about 3-6h/week, about 8-15 submissions, flexible (as of Fall 2022, grading due at Friday 4:30pm every week)

**Requirements:**

- Having taken COS 126 (B+ or better typically, though exceptions are made)
- Score of 3 or higher on the supplemental application quiz (evaluated objectively using a rubric)
- Strong empathetic skills
- Good written communication skills
