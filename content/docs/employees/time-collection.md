title: How to Declare Your Hours
weight: 10
---

Princeton University uses **JobX** to advertise and solicit applications for most student employment jobs on campus (recruiting both undergraduate and graduate students). These jobs are typically hourly jobs, and student employees declare their hours on **TimesheetX**. Below is information on how to use the latter to declare your hours for COS jobs.

For most UCA jobs, the Department of Computer Science does its hiring through [TigerUHR](https://tigeruhr.io). However some jobs, in particular summer research internships, are advertised through JobX.

**You cannot be added to any hourly job until you have completed your official employment paperwork, please make sure you follow all steps outlined in the [Before Getting Paid]({{< ref "/docs/applicants/payroll" >}}) page.**

## How to Get Help

If you have any questions about getting added to payroll or declaring hours, you may contact [Louis Riehl](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/admins), who oversees the department's payroll for Undergraduate Course Assistants.

If you belong to [the UCA Slack]({{< ref "/docs/employees/slack" >}}), you can also ask him questions in the [#payroll channel](https://app.slack.com/client/TU01C5RPG/C01PA7ZFL6N).

6. Once done entering all your hours for a given pay period, click "Submit Time Sheet." **Note: Only one time sheet can be submitted per period; and time sheets cannot be edited once submitted. For this reason, it is important to only submit at the end of pay period, once all entries have been submitted.**
