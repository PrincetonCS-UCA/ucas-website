The goal of the website will be, among other things, to help provide information to both prospective applicants and current students about the different roles and jobs fulfilled by Undergraduate Course Assistants.
The website is built using the Hugo static site generator, the Hugo Book theme, and is hosted on GitHub Pages.</description></item></channel></rss>
