Hello, and I hope your summer is going well!
The Department of Computer Science is hiring enrolled undergraduates (that&amp;rsquo;s you!) to assist in many of our COS courses as Undergraduate Course Assistants (UCAs). This is an opportunity to gain teaching experience, work with and get to know faculty, and contribute back to our undergraduate curriculum.</description></item><item><title>Launching the New Site</title><link>https://ugradjobs.cs.princeton.edu/posts/2021-07-29-launch-of-site/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ugradjobs.cs.princeton.edu/posts/2021-07-29-launch-of-site/</guid><description>This is a website to document the valuable contribution that undergraduate students provide the teaching mission of Princeton University&amp;rsquo;s Deparment of Computer Science, and to provide information on this program.
The goal of the website will be, among other things, to help provide information to both prospective applicants and current students about the different roles and jobs fulfilled by Undergraduate Course Assistants.
The website is built using the Hugo static site generator, the Hugo Book theme, and is hosted on GitHub Pages.</description></item></channel></rss>
