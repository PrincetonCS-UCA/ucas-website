It is being expanded for Spring 2023. Stay tuned!\nGeneral Job Categories # The department employs undergraduates to assist with many COS courses. The jobs are divided into three categories (most paid $16/hr):\nLab TAs who help students in undergraduate-staffed office hours Graders who grade assignments and (in some courses) exams In-class TAs who help students in the classroom (these positions are called facilitators or precept assistants) Some courses also hire a higher-level position (paid $20/hr):\nManagers who coordinate and supervise the work of other UCAs (typically managers have already worked in the course in a previous semester) Specific Job Categories # In addition to the general jobs, there are some specific jobs.\nFor instance, the Intro COS Lab (which centralizes the undergraduate-staffed office hours for COS 109, 126, 217, and 226) hires a Head Intro Lab TA or Team. The Intro COS Lab also hires a team of Interviewers, who interview prospective Intro Lab TAs.\nSeveral courses may hire UCAs on an ad-hoc basis to help with course development or tool building.\nJobs # Below is a description of all the jobs that are available, with a description of their responsibilities.\nThese jobs are not always hiring every semester, so please check TigerUHR directly for the list of jobs currently hiring.\nIntro Lab TA Program # Supervised by Dr. Jérémie Lumbroso (Spring 2023) and the Head Lab TA Team.\nTeam communication: Slack (central COS UCA Slack: #lab-announcements, #126-lab, #2xx-lab)\nThe Intro COS Lab, currently in Lewis 121 and 122, is a place where students taking introductory courses can go for help in debugging their programs. The Intro Lab TAs are those glorious individuals working on the front lines, providing that help. The lab is available to students taking COS 109, COS 126, 217, and 226. The Intro Lab TAs are coordinated by the Head Intro Lab TA (possibly with an Assistant), who is an undergraduate. Most of the shifts are on evenings or weekends, and they last 2 hours. Typically, a TA either has two shifts per week, or is a substitute TA.\nFor more information about the job, the conditions for applying, and the pay rate, please see this page about becoming an Intro Lab TA job.\nThe Intro COS Lab uses the LabQueue to manage the queue of students waiting for help.\nRead specific information about the job responsibilities for:\nthe Intro Lab TA job (which requires an interview if you are a first-time Intro Lab TA) the Interviewers job (apply directly by contacting the Head Intro Lab TA) the Head Intro Lab TA job COS 126 (Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach) # Grader position # Supervised by Dr. Jérémie Lumbroso (Spring 2023)\nTeam communication: Slack (central COS UCA Slack: #126-grading, #126-grading-notifications)\nDescription:\nThis position grades the programming assignments and programming exams, in Java.\nGraders work through codePost to provide high-quality, supportive feedback to introductory CS students.

This paperwork will only need to be filed once during your time at Princeton; for legal reasons, it can only be filed when you have a job offer.\nOnce your tax paperwork is filed, you can be added to the Department of Computer Science\u0026rsquo;s payroll, and start declaring hours using the TimesheetX platform.\nThe most common issue that new hires face is that they do not complete their tax paperwork, and they cannot be added to TimesheetX. The best person to contact for any issues having to do with payroll is Louis Riehl.\nOverview # Before getting paid by the Department of Computer Science, you need to be registered in two different places:\nYou need to be registered with the Student Employment Office to be added to University payroll: They will check your eligibility to work, and collect the necessary tax forms. This is a necessary step for any job on campus, but must only be done once during your time at Princeton.\nOnly once you are registered with the Student Employment Office, can you be added to the department\u0026rsquo;s time collection payroll. This is a step we will do for you, once you have filed your paperwork with the University and been hired in one of our jobs. Only when this step is complete are you allowed to begin work and declare your hours. If you have not completed the first step, our financial administrator will not be able to select you to be added to our payroll.\nOnce these steps have been completed, you will be ready to find out How to Declare Your Hours to get paid.\nYou will typically do Step 1 as soon as possible; if the current procedure outlined by the Student Employment Office, you should aim to take care of the paperwork in your first week on campus. Step 2 can be accomplished as needed as you are hired. Submitting the Student Employment Office Paperwork # Students who are not already on the payroll, can find instructions on the necessary forms to complete at this section of the Student Employment Office website. Since March 2020, the Student Employment Office has allowed these documents to be verified remotely, using video conference; it is unclear how long this practice will continue to be used. Previously, documents needed to be manually brought to the office for verification.\nAs part of your hiring, you will need to fill to U.S. federal tax forms:\nan I-9 form, the purpose of which is to verify that you are eligible to work under U.S. employment law. This will require you to show some documents to prove your identity and your authorization to work in the U.S.;\na W-4 form, the purpose of which is to determine how much the University must withhold from your paycheck to prepay federal taxes. This amount is an approximation of the taxes you might owe, usually an over-approximation which explains why consistently over 80% of U.S. tax-payers get a federal tax refund.\nGetting Added to the Department\u0026rsquo;s Payroll # You need to complete your Student Employment Office Paperwork as soon as possible ideally, before being hired by the department.\nYou have or will apply for a job with the department on TigerUHR. Once you have been hired into a job, you will be added to queue that will notify our financial assistant, Louis Riehl, to add you to the department payroll for the corresponding job.\nIf you have not filed the necessary paperwork, you will not be available to be added to the department\u0026rsquo;s payroll, and an email will be sent to you to let you know that you need to file paperwork before we can take further action.\nSample Hiring Confirmation Message # Once you have been hired, you will be typically receive an email from Louis Riehl outlining the most important aspects of declaring hours.\nThis is a sample message from February 2021:\nThis is to inform you that you have been added to the Payroll System as a XXXXXXXX in Computer Science.\nPlease go to https://princeton.studentemployment.ngwebsolutions.com/Cmx_Content.aspx?cpId=6 (“Student Employees” -\u0026gt; ”My Timesheets”) for instruction on how to enter your hours. If you have multiple roles at Princeton for which you are paid, please be sure to enter your hours associated with the correct role. For example, this includes if you are both a grader and a TA for Computer Science (we pay out these roles on different chart strings, and need an accurate accounting of each).\nPlease also note, if you do not enter your hours by the end of a pay period, you will not get paid on time! (Current period ends 2/21/2021.) Hours need to be entered by the Monday after every 2-week pay period in order to be logged in time for Payroll to process with regular paydays. Hours entered retroactively get paid as backpay, and are delayed. Please enter your hours by the end of every 2-week pay period!\nLet me know if you have any trouble entering your hours.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/general/staff/","title":"Current Staff","section":"\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGeneral Information\u003c/strong\u003e","content":" d # "},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/employees/time-collection/","title":"How to Declare Your Hours","section":"For Current Employees","content":" Summary # Once you have been added to the department\u0026rsquo;s payroll, you can declare the hours that you work in the TimesheetX platform and get paid every few weeks. Overview: What are JobX and TimesheetX? # Princeton University uses JobX to advertise and solicit applications for most student employment jobs on campus (recruiting both undergraduate and graduate students). These jobs are typically hourly jobs, and student employees declare their hours on TimesheetX. Below is information on how to use the latter to declare your hours for COS jobs.\nFor most UCA jobs, the Department of Computer Science does its hiring through TigerUHR. However some jobs, in particular summer research internships, are advertised through JobX.\nYou cannot be added to the payroll for an hourly job until you have completed your official employment paperwork.

Since we get so many more applicants than we can realistically hire, we need to differentiate between them, and assessing their ability to debug in real time along with their ability to explain concepts and their general helping manner is a much better way to differentiate than just looking at grades. [Currently,] we split the interviews between me and 4 other interviewers, two for 126 and two for 226/217,\nFirst, applicants apply on TigerUHR. Then, I reach out to all the applicants who meet the grades criteria (I don’t know what grade it corresponds to, but a 3/5 or higher on TigerUHR) to schedule interviews on a Calendly like. We split the interviews evenly between the interviewers and conduct them remotely, screensharing a code file with 3 bugs and having the candidate walk us through the code as if they were a TA. We use a predetermined rubric to assign a score to each candidate, and we also record comments about their approach and general helping manner. Then, we determine how many TAs we need to hire, and we hire the TAs with the highest scores.\nTAs can be hired for 226/217 or 126, either as full time (2 shifts/week), part time (1 shift/week), or subs. [\u0026hellip;]\nAs the Head TA, I am in charge of conducting interviews and hiring TAs, coordinating training for new TAs, creating the schedule, overseeing TA shadowing, and being the general point person for anything that comes up throughout the semester.\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/docs/general/contribute/","title":"How to Contribute to this Site","section":"\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGeneral Information\u003c/strong\u003e","content":" How to Contribute to this Site # This site is hosted in a public GitHub repository.
