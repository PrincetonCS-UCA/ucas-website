The Strategy Design Czars do not grade assignments, but are responsible for maintaining the codebase for strategy design assignments. This role requires significant independence in comparison to grading, but would be fun for students who enjoyed the strategy designs more than the PSets. If you are interested in this, you should email Matt ( smweinberg@princeton.edu) to discuss.\nResponsibilities (~3-4 hrs/week):\nAttend weekly in-person meeting Fridays 2PM - 3PM. These meetings will tee up grading for the most recently submitted assignment, and we will ask you to stay for the entire hour to grade assignments with other course staff in the room.\nNote:\nWe will always be as efficient as possible with these meetings (e.g. we won\u0026rsquo;t force you to show up if you\u0026rsquo;ve already finished grading). However, we do ask that you think of in-person attendance every week as \u0026ldquo;required\u0026rdquo;, and block this time off on your calendar.\nMany weeks, Matt and/or Mark will take a subset of interested staff out for bubble tea at 3PM.\nGrade asynchronously ~6 hours every 2 weeks. PSets are due every other Monday. Grading tees off on Friday, and is due 10 days later on Tuesday. Because the next cycle starts soon after, we do need to be sticklers about deadlines.\nBe available for ~6-8 hours (total) of grading the final during the two days after it\u0026rsquo;s due (the university has not announced the deadline for each course yet, but we will let everyone know the deadline as as soon as we find out). If you\u0026rsquo;re on-campus, we\u0026rsquo;ll ask that you grade in-person (and provide food/bubble tea). If you\u0026rsquo;re off-campus (which is completely fine), we\u0026rsquo;ll ask that you grade remotely. If your travel plans prevent you from grading (even remotely) during this period, please let Matt know this in advance (but you do not need to change your travel plans to be available).\nThere will be no staff meeting during Spring Break, and it is entirely feasible to complete your responsibilities without working at all over Spring Break. However, some UCAs prefer to grade the midterm over Spring Break, and we will have an optional remote tee-off meeting for those who want to do so.\nBe prepared to give actual feedback on written PSet submissions to help students improve. We will try our best to make this as efficient as possible, but you should be prepared that any assignment that doesn\u0026rsquo;t receive full credit does typically require you to write something specific to that submission (copy/pasting comments across solutions historically leads to confusion by the students and results in appeals that we have to resolve anyway).\n[For Strategy Design Czars only] There is a codebase for strategy designs on github that, afaik, is complete, bug-free, etc. However, every SD still requires an initialization (TigerFile submission needs to be set up for every SD, sample files need to be uploaded for students, files need to be downloaded from TigerFile), and a run (some submissions have bugs and will crash the execution, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to figure out which ones and edit/remove them, etc.). You will also be responsible for answering any questions about the coding portion of the SDs (because Matt/Marcel may not know the answer). This requires more independence than a typical UCA role, because this has always been designed/maintained by UCAs (there is a detailed SD czar onboarding document, and previous years\u0026rsquo; czars are often happy to answer quick questions).\n[For Strategy Design Czars only] You are free to do more interesting things with the SD codebase, if that interests you. For example, you are free to add more \u0026lsquo;check submitted files\u0026rsquo; test cases so that there\u0026rsquo;s fewer buggy submissions, write more efficient code, write new \u0026lsquo;staff solutions\u0026rsquo;, or develop any new infrastructure that you think would be beneficial. But this is entirely optional\u0026ndash;your \u0026lsquo;responsibility\u0026rsquo; is just to make sure that SD files are uploaded in a timely fashion, and grades are computed in a timely fashion as well.\nRequirements:\nMust have taken COS 445 and gotten an A- or better. (If you have taken COS 445 and are interested in being a UCA, but did not earn an A- or better, feel free to reach out to Matt to discuss).\nMust be available for a weekly 2-3PM staff meeting on Fridays, in-person.\nIf you apply for this position, we will assume that you\u0026rsquo;ll block off every Friday 2-3PM for an in-person meeting. Exceptions are possible (and we understand there will be sporadic absences), but you should email Matt ( smweinberg@princeton.edu) with your situation before applying for this position.\nCOS 448: Innovating Across Technology, Business, and Marketplaces # For description and past ratings, see course page on Princeton Courses.\nSupervised by Prof. Robert Fish (Fall 2023)\nTeam communication: centralized Slack (TBD)\nDescription: Students will assist the class AI’s in scoring assignments and speaker reflections based on a rubric.

This paperwork will only need to be filed once during your time at Princeton; for legal reasons, it can only be filed when you have a job offer.\nOnce your tax paperwork is filed, you can be added to the Department of Computer Science\u0026rsquo;s payroll, and start declaring hours using the TimesheetX platform.\nThe most common issue that new hires face is that they do not complete their tax paperwork, and they cannot be added to TimesheetX. The best person to contact for any issues having to do with payroll is Louis Riehl.\nOverview # Before getting paid by the Department of Computer Science, you need to be registered in two different places:\nYou need to be registered with the Student Employment Office to be added to University payroll: They will check your eligibility to work, and collect the necessary tax forms. This is a necessary step for any job on campus, but must only be done once during your time at Princeton.\nOnly once you are registered with the Student Employment Office, can you be added to the department\u0026rsquo;s time collection payroll. This is a step we will do for you, once you have filed your paperwork with the University and been hired in one of our jobs. Only when this step is complete are you allowed to begin work and declare your hours. If you have not completed the first step, our financial administrator will not be able to select you to be added to our payroll.\nOnce these steps have been completed, you will be ready to find out How to Declare Your Hours to get paid.\nYou will typically do Step 1 as soon as possible; if the current procedure outlined by the Student Employment Office, you should aim to take care of the paperwork in your first week on campus. Step 2 can be accomplished as needed as you are hired. Submitting the Student Employment Office Paperwork # Students who are not already on the payroll, can find instructions on the necessary forms to complete at this section of the Student Employment Office website. Since March 2020, the Student Employment Office has allowed these documents to be verified remotely, using video conference; it is unclear how long this practice will continue to be used. Previously, documents needed to be manually brought to the office for verification.\nAs part of your hiring, you will need to fill to U.S. federal tax forms:\nan I-9 form, the purpose of which is to verify that you are eligible to work under U.S. employment law. This will require you to show some documents to prove your identity and your authorization to work in the U.S.;\na W-4 form, the purpose of which is to determine how much the University must withhold from your paycheck to prepay federal taxes. This amount is an approximation of the taxes you might owe, usually an over-approximation which explains why consistently over 80% of U.S. tax-payers get a federal tax refund.\nGetting Added to the Department\u0026rsquo;s Payroll # You need to complete your Student Employment Office Paperwork as soon as possible ideally, before being hired by the department.\nYou have or will apply for a job with the department on TigerUHR. Once you have been hired into a job, you will be added to queue that will notify our financial assistant, Elizabeth Wang, to add you to the department payroll for the corresponding job.\nIf you have not filed the necessary paperwork, you will not be available to be added to the department\u0026rsquo;s payroll, and an email will be sent to you to let you know that you need to file paperwork before we can take further action.\nSample Hiring Confirmation Message # Once you have been hired, you will be typically receive an email from Louis Riehl outlining the most important aspects of declaring hours.\nThis is a sample message from February 2021:\nThis is to inform you that you have been added to the Payroll System as a XXXXXXXX in Computer Science.\nPlease go to https://princeton.studentemployment.ngwebsolutions.com/Cmx_Content.aspx?cpId=6 (“Student Employees” -\u0026gt; ”My Timesheets”) for instruction on how to enter your hours. If you have multiple roles at Princeton for which you are paid, please be sure to enter your hours associated with the correct role. For example, this includes if you are both a grader and a TA for Computer Science (we pay out these roles on different chart strings, and need an accurate accounting of each).\nPlease also note, if you do not enter your hours by the end of a pay period, you will not get paid on time! (Current period ends 2/21/2021.) Hours need to be entered by the Monday after every 2-week pay period in order to be logged in time for Payroll to process with regular paydays. Hours entered retroactively get paid as backpay, and are delayed. Please enter your hours by the end of every 2-week pay period!\nLet me know if you have any trouble entering your hours.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/general/staff/","title":"Current Staff","section":"\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGeneral Information\u003c/strong\u003e","content":" TBD # "},{"id":9,"href":"/docs/employees/time-collection/","title":"How to Declare Your Hours","section":"For Current Employees","content":" Summary # Once you have been added to the department\u0026rsquo;s payroll, you can declare the hours that you work in the TimesheetX platform and get paid every few weeks. Overview: What are JobX and TimesheetX? # Princeton University uses JobX to advertise and solicit applications for most student employment jobs on campus (recruiting both undergraduate and graduate students). These jobs are typically hourly jobs, and student employees declare their hours on TimesheetX. Below is information on how to use the latter to declare your hours for COS jobs.\nFor most UCA jobs, the Department of Computer Science does its hiring through TigerUHR. However some jobs, in particular summer research internships, are advertised through JobX.\nYou cannot be added to the payroll for an hourly job until you have completed your official employment paperwork. Please make sure you follow all steps outlined in the Before Getting Paid page.

Since we get so many more applicants than we can realistically hire, we need to differentiate between them, and assessing their ability to debug in real time along with their ability to explain concepts and their general helping manner is a much better way to differentiate than just looking at grades. [Currently,] we split the interviews between me and 4 other interviewers, two for 126 and two for 226/217,\nFirst, applicants apply on TigerUHR. Then, I reach out to all the applicants who meet the grades criteria (I don’t know what grade it corresponds to, but a 3/5 or higher on TigerUHR) to schedule interviews on a Calendly like. We split the interviews evenly between the interviewers and conduct them remotely, screensharing a code file with 3 bugs and having the candidate walk us through the code as if they were a TA. We use a predetermined rubric to assign a score to each candidate, and we also record comments about their approach and general helping manner. Then, we determine how many TAs we need to hire, and we hire the TAs with the highest scores.\nTAs can be hired for 226/217 or 126, either as full time (2 shifts/week), part time (1 shift/week), or subs. [\u0026hellip;]\nAs the Head TA, I am in charge of conducting interviews and hiring TAs, coordinating training for new TAs, creating the schedule, overseeing TA shadowing, and being the general point person for anything that comes up throughout the semester.\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/docs/general/contribute/","title":"How to Contribute to this Site","section":"\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGeneral Information\u003c/strong\u003e","content":" How to Contribute to this Site # This site is hosted in a public GitHub repository.
