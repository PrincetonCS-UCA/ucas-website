The jobs are divided into three categories (most paid $17/hr):\nLab TAs who help students in undergraduate-staffed office hours Graders who grade assignments and (in some courses) exams In-class TAs who help students in the classroom (these positions are called facilitators or precept assistants) Some Independent Work (IW) seminars also hires 1-2 UCAs to do a combination of all three jobs (assisting in class to provide feedback to student presenting their projects, grading projects, and providing office hours for students to get help with their projects).\nFinally, some courses also hire a higher-level position (paid $20/hr):\nManagers who coordinate and supervise the work of other UCAs (typically managers have already worked in the course in a previous semester) Specific Job Categories # In addition to the general jobs, there are some specific jobs.\nFor instance, the Intro COS Lab (which centralizes the undergraduate-staffed office hours for COS 109, 126, 217, and 226) hires a Head Intro Lab TA or Team. The Intro COS Lab also hires a team of Interviewers, who interview prospective Intro Lab TAs.\nSeveral courses may hire UCAs on an ad-hoc basis to help with course development or tool building.\nJobs # Below is a description of all the jobs that are available, with a description of their responsibilities.\nThese jobs are not always hiring every semester, so please check TigerUHR directly for the list of jobs currently hiring.\nIntro COS Lab TA Program # Supervised by UCA hiring coordinators and the Head Lab TA Team.\nTeam communication: Slack ( central COS UCA Slack: #lab-announcements, #126-lab, #2xx-lab)\nThe Intro COS Lab, currently in Lewis 121 and 122, is a place where students taking introductory courses can go for help in debugging their programs.

That is, every UCA must grade assignments, and it is perfectly acceptable for a UCA to only grade assignments.\nUCAs who are interested in other tasks (such as helping answer questions on Ed, providing advice on course policy, etc.) are welcome to do so (and be paid to do so).\nAdditionally 1-2 UCAs can instead volunteer to be the \u0026ldquo;Strategy Design Czar(s)\u0026rdquo;. The Strategy Design Czars do not grade assignments, but are responsible for maintaining the codebase for strategy design assignments. This role requires significant independence in comparison to grading, but would be fun for students who enjoyed the strategy designs more than the PSets. If you are interested in this, you should email Matt ( smweinberg@princeton.edu) and Pedro ( pparedes@princeton.edu) to discuss.\nResponsibilities (~3-4 hrs/week):\nAttend weekly in-person meeting Thursdays 4:30PM-5:30PM. These meetings will tee up grading for the most recently submitted assignment, and we will ask you to stay for the entire hour to grade assignments with other course staff in the room.\nNote:\nWe will always be as efficient as possible with these meetings (e.g. we won\u0026rsquo;t force you to show up if you\u0026rsquo;ve already finished grading, and we won\u0026rsquo;t force you to come in-person if you\u0026rsquo;ve previously attended a tee-off meeting and just need to sporadically ask questions, etc.). However, we do ask that you think of in-person attendance every week as the default, and block this time off on your calendar.\nMany weeks, Matt and/or Pedro will take a subset of interested staff out for bubble tea at 5:30PM.\nGrade asynchronously ~6 hours every 2 weeks. PSets are due every other Monday. Grading tees off on Thursday, and is due 10 days later on Monday. Because the next cycle starts soon after, we do need to be sticklers about deadlines.\nBe available for ~6-8 hours (total) of grading the final on May 18/19. You do not need to change your travel plans to be on-campus to grade the final. If you have travel plans that prohibit you from grading (even remotely) during this period, this is OK, but please let Matt/Pedro know in advance.\nThere will be no staff meeting during Spring Break, and it is entirely feasible to complete your responsibilities without working at all over Spring Break. However, some UCAs prefer to grade the midterm over Spring Break, and we will have an optional remote tee-off meeting for those who want to do so.\nBe prepared to give actual feedback on written PSet submissions to help students improve. We will try our best to make this as efficient as possible, but you should be prepared that any assignment that doesn\u0026rsquo;t receive full credit does typically require you to write something specific to that submission.\n[For Strategy Design Czars only] There is a codebase for strategy designs on github that, afaik, is complete, bug-free, etc. However, every SD still requires an initialization (TigerFile submission needs to be set up for every SD, sample files need to be uploaded for students, files need to be downloaded from TigerFile), and a run (some submissions have bugs and will crash the execution, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to figure out which ones and edit/remove them, etc.). You will also be responsible for answering any questions about the coding portion of the SDs (because Matt/Pedro may not know the answer). This requires more independence than a typical UCA role, because this has always been designed/maintained by UCAs (there is a detailed SD czar onboarding document, and last year\u0026rsquo;s czar is an ECE MSE student who offered to be accessible with questions).\n[For Strategy Design Czars only] You are free to do more interesting things with the SD codebase, if that interests you. For example, you are free to add more \u0026lsquo;check submitted files\u0026rsquo; test cases so that there\u0026rsquo;s fewer buggy submissions, write more efficient code, write new \u0026lsquo;staff solutions\u0026rsquo;, or develop any new infrastructure that you think would be beneficial. But this is entirely optional—your \u0026lsquo;responsibility\u0026rsquo; is just to make sure that SD files are uploaded in a timely fashion, and grades are computed in a timely fashion as well.\u0026quot;\nRequirements:\nHaving taken COS 445 and gotten an B+ or better\nMust be available for a weekly 4:30PM-5:30PM staff meeting on Thursdays, in-person.\nIf you apply for this position, we will assume you are generally available 4:30PM-5:30PM Thursdays for an in-person meeting.

This is important to understand the environment in which you will have to work.\nA course with systematically high evaluations is probably both well-managed and run by faculty who are good managers.\nA course with low evaluations may often be very rewarding, as they are the courses that would most benefit from UCAs, and in which UCAs have the greatest impact and opportunity for growth.

For this reason, if you apply, are interviewed and offered a job of Intro Lab TA, it will override your preferences, you will be assigned to it and cannot turn it down; on the flip side, this means if you are unsure whether you might get a UCA job, applying to the Intro COS Lab increases your chances significantly.\nYou may be found suitable for multiple jobs, and you will be hired first in the highest priority jobs for which you have expressed a STRONG preference. If you turn down an offer for your highest priority job AND you had expressed a STRONG preference for this job, we will not offer you a position in another course and you will not be offered an UCA job for this campaign.\nYou may accept positions for multiple courses, up to your discretion. However it is very important that you do not turn down a job you have already accepted; failure to abide by these terms may result in a mark in your record.\nThese rules are intended to provide stability for the faculty and to ensure that our most important courses are properly staffed.\nWhen you are hired # Once you have been hired, you will receive an email from the Department of Computer Science introducing you to your faculty supervisor.\nAfter that point, the responsibility will be to the faculty supervisor to follow up with you and get you on-boarded.\nIf you have been hired for a job, but have not been onboarded, please contact us.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/timeline/","title":"TIMELINE FOR HIRING","section":"Docs","content":"This is a page that will contain details about the timeline.

This paperwork will only need to be filed once during your time at Princeton; for legal reasons, it can only be filed when you have a job offer.\nOnce your tax paperwork is filed, you can be added to the Department of Computer Science\u0026rsquo;s payroll, and start declaring hours using the TimesheetX platform.\nThe most common issue that new hires face is that they do not complete their tax paperwork, and they cannot be added to TimesheetX. The best person to contact for any issues having to do with payroll is Louis Riehl.\nOverview # Before getting paid by the Department of Computer Science, you need to be registered in two different places:\nYou need to be registered with the Student Employment Office to be added to University payroll: They will check your eligibility to work, and collect the necessary tax forms. This is a necessary step for any job on campus, but must only be done once during your time at Princeton.\nOnly once you are registered with the Student Employment Office, can you be added to the department\u0026rsquo;s time collection payroll. This is a step we will do for you, once you have filed your paperwork with the University and been hired in one of our jobs. Only when this step is complete are you allowed to begin work and declare your hours. If you have not completed the first step, our financial administrator will not be able to select you to be added to our payroll.\nOnce these steps have been completed, you will be ready to find out How to Declare Your Hours to get paid.\nYou will typically do Step 1 as soon as possible; if the current procedure outlined by the Student Employment Office, you should aim to take care of the paperwork in your first week on campus. Step 2 can be accomplished as needed as you are hired. Submitting the Student Employment Office Paperwork # Students who are not already on the payroll, can find instructions on the necessary forms to complete at this section of the Student Employment Office website. Since March 2020, the Student Employment Office has allowed these documents to be verified remotely, using video conference; it is unclear how long this practice will continue to be used. Previously, documents needed to be manually brought to the office for verification.\nAs part of your hiring, you will need to fill to U.S. federal tax forms:\nan I-9 form, the purpose of which is to verify that you are eligible to work under U.S. employment law. This will require you to show some documents to prove your identity and your authorization to work in the U.S.;\na W-4 form, the purpose of which is to determine how much the University must withhold from your paycheck to prepay federal taxes. This amount is an approximation of the taxes you might owe, usually an over-approximation which explains why consistently over 80% of U.S. tax-payers get a federal tax refund.\nGetting Added to the Department\u0026rsquo;s Payroll # You need to complete your Student Employment Office Paperwork as soon as possible ideally, before being hired by the department.\nYou have or will apply for a job with the department on TigerUHR.

Since we get so many more applicants than we can realistically hire, we need to differentiate between them, and assessing their ability to debug in real time along with their ability to explain concepts and their general helping manner is a much better way to differentiate than just looking at grades. [Currently,] we split the interviews between me and 4 other interviewers, two for 126 and two for 226/217,\nFirst, applicants apply on TigerUHR. Then, I reach out to all the applicants who meet the grades criteria (I don’t know what grade it corresponds to, but a 3/5 or higher on TigerUHR) to schedule interviews on a Calendly like. We split the interviews evenly between the interviewers and conduct them remotely, screensharing a code file with 3 bugs and having the candidate walk us through the code as if they were a TA. We use a predetermined rubric to assign a score to each candidate, and we also record comments about their approach and general helping manner. Then, we determine how many TAs we need to hire, and we hire the TAs with the highest scores.\nTAs can be hired for 226/217 or 126, either as full time (2 shifts/week), part time (1 shift/week), or subs.
