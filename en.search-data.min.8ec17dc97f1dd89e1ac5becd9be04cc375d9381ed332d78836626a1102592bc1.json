It uses the Hugo static site generator and the actual pages are written in Markdown (see cheat sheet here). It is published using GitHub Pages.\nAnybody with a GitHub account, can suggest changes to a page with only two or three clicks, like for Wikipedia.\nIf you have made several contributions, you may be made a collaborator and you will be able to directly modify the site without requiring approval. (Since GitHub is a version control system, all changes are tracked and it is easy to undo specific changes, if they are later identified as malicious).\nFirst Step #  On any page of this site, including this one, you can find a link at the bottom, or bottom-right of the site, that is captioned \u0026ldquo; Edit this page\u0026rdquo;.\nHow to contribute if you are not a collaborator #  If you are not a collaborator, you push changes to the repository directly: You must first make fork to your repository. Fortunately GitHub both clearly indicates when this must happen, and transparently creates the fork for you such that this step of the process is completely transparent to you.\n "},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/applicants/apply/","title":"How/When to Apply","section":"\u003cstrong\u003eFor Prospective Applicants\u003c/strong\u003e","content":"This is a page to explain how/when to apply.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/applicants/payroll/","title":"Before Getting Paid\u0026hellip;","section":"\u003cstrong\u003eFor Prospective Applicants\u003c/strong\u003e","content":"This is a page to provide indications of everything that needs to be done before getting paid.\n"}]
