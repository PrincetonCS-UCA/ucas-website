Lab TAs are undergraduates hired to work in the computer labs to help students taking COS 126, 217, and 226 (the Intro COS Lab). This web form will allow you to apply for any of these positions. This is an opportunity to gain experience and contribute back to the department. The pay rate for each position is $15.50 per hour. — About grading: The duties of an undergraduate grader include analyzing submitted programs for correctness, efficiency, and clarity, and providing written feedback. The workload is at most six hours per week. For some courses (such as COS 126, 226, and 340), this can include attendance at a weekly grading party, to discuss rubrics, calibrate standards, and begin grading. The grader is also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of student educational records, subject to FERPA's requirements. — About the Intro COS Lab (for COS 126, 217 and 226): The department offers a lab where students taking introductory courses can go for help in debugging their programs — the lab TAs are those individuals working on the front lines, providing that help. The lab is available to students taking COS 126, 217, and 226. The lab TAs are coordinated by the head lab TA, who is an undergraduate. Most of the shifts are on evenings or weekends, and they last 2 hours. Typically, a TA either has two shifts per week, or is a substitute TA. — Some additional courses (which are not COS 126, 217 or 226) also have lab TAs: This is for example the case for COS 340. Please apply as a lab TA for the specific course(s) you are interested in. To apply, please fill out this form. It is not required that you be a Computer Science concentrator, but you must be a current Princeton undergraduate and have completed the course you wish to assist as well as both COS 217 and COS 226 before the start of the semester. Exceptions: COS 217 and 226 graders need not have completed the other COS 217 or 226 course; COS 126 graders/lab TAs need not have completed COS 217 nor COS 226.

It uses the Hugo static site generator and the actual pages are written in Markdown (see cheat sheet here). It is published using GitHub Pages.\nAnybody with a GitHub account, can suggest changes to an existing page with only two or three clicks, like for Wikipedia. (Anybody can also propose new pages, but that requires a few more clicks.)\nIf you have made several contributions, you may be made a collaborator and you will be able to directly modify the site without requiring approval. (Since GitHub is a version control system, all changes are tracked and it is easy to undo specific changes, if they are later identified as malicious).\nBelow we outline how to suggest a change for any existing page on the website to get you started. This is a good opportunity to get to know GitHub and version control systems, which is are really important tools.\nFirst Step: Click \u0026ldquo;Edit this page\u0026rdquo; #  On any page of this site, including this one, you can find a link at the bottom, or bottom-right of the site, that is captioned Edit this page. The next step depends on whether you are a collaborator or not.\nHow to suggest a change if you are not a collaborator #  If you are not a collaborator, you cannot push changes to the repository directly: You must first make fork to your repository. Fortunately GitHub both clearly indicates when this must happen, and transparently creates the fork for you such that this step of the process is completely transparent to you.\n You can click \u0026ldquo;Fork this repository\u0026rdquo; and then follow the steps outlined starting in Step 2 of GitHub\u0026rsquo;s guide on Editing Files in Another User\u0026rsquo;s Repository.\nThank you in advance for your contribution! Depending on whether the semester is busy, your contribution will be reviewed soon. Once several of your contributions have been accepted, we will likely consider making you a collaborator!\nHow to suggest a change if you are a collaborator #  If you are a collaborator, there is no need for a fork: You can edit files directly as though were the owner of the files.

[Their website](https://puwebp.princeton.edu/StudentEmployment/index.jsf) explains what you need to bring to their office to register. Read it BEFORE you come to campus. Hiring requires being on the university payroll. Indeed, you need to be registered in two places before you can be paid by the Department of Computer Science: 1. You need to be registered with the Student Employment Office to be added to university payroll: They will check your eligibility to work, and collect the necessary tax forms. This is a necessary step for any job on campus, but must only be done once during your time at Princeton. 2. Only once you are registered with the Student Employment Office, can you be added to the department's time collection payroll. This is a step we will do for you, once you have filed your paperwork with the University. Only when this step is complete are you allowed to begin work. From Louis:\nThis is to inform you that you have been added to the Payroll System as a Grader in Computer Science. Please go to https://princeton.studentemployment.ngwebsolutions.com/Cmx_Content.aspx?cpId=6 (“Student Employees”-\u0026gt;”My Timesheets”) for instruction on how to enter your hours. If you have multiple roles at Princeton for which you are paid, please be sure to enter your hours associated with the correct role. For example, this includes if you are both a grader and a TA for Computer Science (we pay out these roles on different chart strings, and need an accurate accounting of each). Please also note, if you do not enter your hours by the end of a pay period, you will not get paid on time! (Current period ends 2/21/2021.) Hours need to be entered by the Monday after every 2-week pay period in order to be logged in time for Payroll to process with regular paydays. Hours entered retroactively get paid as backpay, and are delayed. Please enter your hours by the end of every 2-week pay period! Let me know if you have any trouble entering your hours. This is to inform you that you have been added to the Time \u0026amp; Labor Payroll System for the Fall 2020 Semester as a COS 126 Grader in Computer Science. Please Note: If you are currently on a leave of absence (LOA), or take one in the future during the term of this employment, please let us know immediately and do not work or log any hours after your LOA has started! Unfortunately we are not permitted to continue employing you as students while you are on LOA, and any hours logged will be flagged by Student Employment and not permitted for payment. Please go to https://finance.princeton.edu/payroll-labor-accounting/payroll/time-absence-management-project for instruction on how to enter your hours (“Students paid hourly” heading). If you have multiple roles at Princeton for which you are paid, please be sure to enter your hours associated with the correct role. This includes if you are hired for multiple role in for Computer Science (we pay out these roles on different chart strings, and need an accurate accounting of each). Please also note, as with the previous system, if you do not enter your hours by the end of a pay period, you will not get paid on time! Hours need to be entered by the Sunday ending every 2-week pay period in order to be logged in time for Payroll to process with regular paydays. (The current pay period ends Sunday, 10/4/2020.) Hours entered retroactively get paid as backpay, and are delayed. Further, in the new system please note that we only have the ability to enter hours retroactively up to 90 days. Hours not entered beyond that need to be entered by Finance \u0026amp; Treasury directly (we can’t do it), and will be further delayed. Please enter your hours by the end of every 2-week pay period! ```å "}]
