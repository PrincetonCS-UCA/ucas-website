These jobs are typically hourly jobs, and student employees declare their hours on TimesheetX. Below is information on how to use the latter to declare your hours for COS jobs.
For most UCA jobs, the Department of Computer Science does its hiring through TigerUHR. However some jobs, in particular summer research internships, are advertised through JobX.</description></item><item><title>How/When to Apply</title><link>https://ugradjobs.cs.princeton.edu/docs/applicants/apply/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ugradjobs.cs.princeton.edu/docs/applicants/apply/</guid><description>This is a page to explain how/when to apply.
